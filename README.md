## Meals App

---

## ℹ️ About this repository
This repository's main objective is to demonstrate the application developed to train my knowledge during the Flutter course from the company [COD3R](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/).

This app consists of:
- List meal categories.
- List meals linked to a particular meal category.
- Filter meals based on user-defined settings.
- Manage meals marked as favorites by the user.

This project, although simple, aims to review the concepts of navigation between screens using Flutter.

## 📝 Notes
During the course I made some changes to the project. I used the latest version of flutter available to date (flutter v3.16.2 and dart v3.2.2). I tried to use another color style after all I didn't like the style used during the course. I also used the google_fonts and font_awesome_flutter packages.
